Python - More Classes and Objects

This repository contains my solutions to the "More Classes and Objects" projec  in the Python programming language.
Description

In this project, I created a class called Rectangle that defines a rectangle. The class does not have any attributes or methods yet, but it serves as a starting point for implementing a more complete Rectangle class.

Technologies Used
Python 3.8.5
pycodestyle 2.8

Files
1-rectangle.py: contains the implementation of the Rectangle class
Usage
To use the Rectangle class, simply import it into your Python program and create instances of the class. For example:

python
Copy code
from rectangle import Rectangle

rect = Rectangle()
